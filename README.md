## what makes us different 
- ### a shared buffer betwwen copy and cut
    you can copy some files and cut some files and paste them at the same place

- ### a flexable buffer
  you can delete and add as much as you want from the paste buffer <br>
  which gives you the abslute control on what you will paste now if you made a mistake

## Pin Feature

The pin feature allows you to bookmark important directories and files for quick navigation using a popup window. **Pins are automatically saved and persist between application runs.**

- **Pin an item**: Press `P` when a file or directory is selected to add it to your pins
- **Open pins popup**: Press `o` to open the pins popup window
- **Navigate in popup**: Use arrow keys (‚Üë/‚Üì) to navigate through pinned items
- **Go to pin**: Press `Enter` while in the popup to navigate to the selected pin
- **Close popup**: Press `Esc` to close the pins popup
- **Unpin item**: Press `u` to remove the currently selected item from pins (if it's pinned)
- **Remove pin**: Press `U` while in the popup to remove the selected pin from the list

The popup displays directories with üìÅ and files with üìÑ icons, making it easy to identify pin types at a glance.

### Persistence
Pins are automatically saved to `~/.fileio_pins` (or `.fileio_pins` in the current directory if `$HOME` is not available). The file stores the full paths of pinned items, and upon startup, the application automatically loads saved pins. If a pinned path no longer exists, it will be silently ignored during loading.

## Get started 
### dependencies
make sure that you have 
`xdp-open` to open files in their defulat app
### simple way
you can simply download the executable from the releases and then move it to /bin or any other folders that are in the path
```
sudo mv fileio /bin
```
